# AOC2023
My solutions to Advent of Code 2023.

Doing this in C to test and sharpen my skills.  For that reason I am also trying to structure this as a proper project, with the main logic held in appropriately placed library functions, and a `main` function that is short and easy to read.

# Quickstart
Type `make` at the top level.  The executable for each day will be in the `bin` subdirectory of the folder for that day.
